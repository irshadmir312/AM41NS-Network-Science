Hello! I'm Irshad Majeed Mir, a dedicated and enthusiastic BTech graduate in Computer Science, with a passion for developing innovative solutions through coding and project development. Currently, I'm enhancing my skills in data science at Aston University, and I freelance to support a variety of client needs in software and web development.

My portfolio includes projects like SmartRoom, an IoT and AI-based system for monitoring indoor air quality, and an AI-driven Object Detection App for visually impaired users. I specialize in using cutting-edge technologies such as Django, MATLAB, and machine learning frameworks to deliver high-quality, efficient solutions.

If you are interested in my work and would like to discuss how I can help with your project, or if you want access to the full code of my projects, please feel free to reach out. Contact me on WhatsApp or email me for prompt and detailed responses.

College of Engineering & Physical Sciences Assignment Brief
  
AM41NS â€“ Network Science Coursework â€“ Part A
Roberto C. Alamino alaminrc@aston.ac.uk
Assignment Brief/ Coursework Content:
â€¢ Theoretical and Computational Techniques
â€¢ This coursework assesses all learning outcomes on the first part of the
moduleâ€™s content. (See Assessment Rationale on Moduleâ€™s Specification for more details.)
 
Descriptive details of Assignment:
â€¢ This is an individual work.
â€¢ Justify every answer with all relevant details. Include and mention explicitly
all methods and references (when appropriate), including from every dataset
you use. Failure to do so will lead to the loss of marks.
â€¢ The coursework should be submitted as one single file: a Jupyter notebook
with all solutions and code in the correct order. The filename should be:
[Your_student_number].ipynb.
â€¢ Any additional file will not be considered as part of the submission and will not
be marked.
â€¢ Code in the format of a Python file instead of a Jupyter notebook will not be
considered for marking.
â€¢ Your code should be properly commented, with all variables and functions
clearly explained.
â€¢ The code on your notebook should run without problems or conflicts in any
computer. Make sure that the libraries you use have no conflicts with other
libraries. In case of doubt, stick to what has been used during the lectures.
â€¢ All cells which do not run will be deleted, which can have consequences to
cells below them. Therefore, be sure that all cells run without problems.
â€¢ Text and analytical calculations should be presented as markdown. Mathematical formulas should be rendered in LATEX (between $$) or typed
and pasted as an image on the notebook.
â€¢ Whenever a question asks you to relate quantities to the nature of the
network, you should explain how they affect the functioning of the physical system represented by the network. Just describing the values without connection with the physical role of the network is not enough.
â€¢ Wherever third-party sources are used, you are obliged to include the appropriate reference. Failure to do so might lead to a plagiarism process.
â€¢ Analysing a network different from the one you were asked to will imply a penalty of 50% on the marks of the corresponding exercise after marking.
â€¢ Use the appropriate technical language taught during the module. Do not invent new terms, unless you carefully and rigorously define them beforehand. Do not use non-technical language to describe mathematical entities as it is not precise enough and prone to ambiguity.
 
Recommended reading/ online sources:
â€¢ Reading list, recorded lectures, lecture slides and any other material on the moduleâ€™s Blackboard page.
